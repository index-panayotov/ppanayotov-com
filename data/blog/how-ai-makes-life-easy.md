# How AI Makes Life Easy: Building a Website with Multiple AI Models

In today's fast-paced development landscape, leveraging Artificial Intelligence can significantly streamline workflows and accelerate project delivery. My recent experience building this very website is a testament to the power of AI, specifically by orchestrating multiple AI models like Gemini-CLI, Claude Code, and OpenAI.

## The AI Orchestra: Why Multiple Models?

One might ask, why use several AI models when one could suffice? The answer lies in specialization and overcoming individual limitations. Each AI model, while powerful, possesses unique strengths and weaknesses.

### Gemini-CLI: The Cost-Effective Code Maestro

Gemini-CLI proved to be an invaluable asset for generating high-quality code at a remarkably low cost. Its ability to understand complex instructions and produce clean, functional code snippets was a game-changer. For core logic and component generation, Gemini-CLI consistently delivered, making it a go-to for foundational development tasks.

### OpenAI: The Unseen Operator

While I prefer to handle command execution and project building myself, OpenAI's capabilities in these areas are undeniable. It can seamlessly run commands, start development servers, and manage build processes without explicit instructions. This "hands-off" approach can be incredibly efficient for certain workflows, though I personally prefer more control over these critical steps.

### Claude Code: The Iterative Assistant

Claude Code, with its rapid response times, was excellent for quick iterations and understanding context. However, it often ran out of message capacity quickly and struggled to retain a long-term memory of the codebase. This made it ideal for short, focused tasks and brainstorming, but less suited for prolonged, complex refactoring efforts.

## The Synergy of AI

The true power emerged from combining these models. I would often:
*   Use Gemini-CLI for initial code generation and complex logic.
*   Leverage Claude Code for quick debugging, minor adjustments, and understanding specific code sections.
*   Manually execute commands and manage the build process, sometimes using OpenAI's insights for guidance.

This multi-model approach allowed me to capitalize on each AI's strengths while mitigating their weaknesses, leading to a highly efficient and cost-effective development process. The result is the website you are currently browsing, built with the collaborative intelligence of these remarkable AI tools.
